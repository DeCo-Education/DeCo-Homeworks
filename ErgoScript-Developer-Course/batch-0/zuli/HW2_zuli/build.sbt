//As a method in a class, meaning it has access to the other members in the same class

//Syntax
//Not sure what we are supposed to write here...
//A Scala program can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each otherâ€™s methods.
//Method: A method is like some specific behavior. A class can contain many methods.
//It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
