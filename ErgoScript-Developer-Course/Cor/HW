eUTxOs

In UTxO the Validator doesn’t look at the whole Tx, it only looks at the invoking input. Τhe difference between UTxOs and eUTxOs is eUTxOs have “Tx” for the Validator (powerset x Tx) whereas UTxOs have Validators indifferent to most of the Txs and only look at the first Input in the Input list of the Tx. eUTxOs are UTxOs with smart contract capability in terms of multi-stage contracts where the contract is executed in steps linearly so that the computational cost can be estimated ahead of signing.
Inputs spend previously unspent outputs (UTxOs) IN TOTAL. Inputs point left to outputs of the same position identifier, that are pointed to from the right, for the amount that supersedes the spend amount to be validated back to the sender. A tx where an output validates that the input has been made is a valid tx in the eUTxO model. In order for data to validate it has to be cryptographically solved.
