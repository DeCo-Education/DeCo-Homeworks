# Ergo School

Ergo School’s mission is to provide a learning platform for on-boarding Ergo developers at scale. We will do this through funneling the DeCo curriculum into a self-paced online learning course in which students build real-world projects. 
Students will learn through doing and may pick and choose which projects to build. Each project will be designed to focus on utilizing one or a set of commonly used core concepts in building dapps on Ergo. Information will be funneled in from the DeCo curriculum and be layered and presented in an “as needed” basis to keep it fun and reduce information overload. The goal is to take beginners to a level where they can have a foundation to then self-study and build on their own. Community-building and creating an environment where community helps community is essential. This can evolve to be a parallel track to the DeCo live curriculum. 

## Example Project Structure: 
1. Overview of project with demo of what we’re going to build.
2. Text-based overview of fundamental eUTXO and Ergoscript concepts which will be used in the project. 
3. Tutorial on setting up development environment. 
4. Walk through of building the dapp. 
5. Challenge student to improvise and improve upon the dapp. 
6. Encourage sharing of the dapp with community, social media, etc. 

*The idea for this project was inspired by [Buildspace](http://buildspace.so), an EVM-focused web3 learning platform and community which has onboarded thousands of Solidity developers.*
