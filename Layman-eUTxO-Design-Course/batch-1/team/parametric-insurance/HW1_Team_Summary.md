# Background
The insurance industry makes up one of the key pillars of ***TradFi*** and has helped play its part in the growth and development of economies and society throughout history. As different individuals have different risk appetites, insurance provides society an opportunity to pool together risks in a way to reduce the burden on the single customer in case of bad outcome.

1. However, upon a current state assessment of the sector, two observations have emerged:
Firstly, there is a high-level of mistrust between the customer (policy holder) and the insurer. Insurers are incentivised to make profits - with the key levers being increasing the top line revenue from increased premiums or by reducing the amount paid out in claims. Similarly, customers are incentivised to make false or larger claims to cover their losses. This ultimately results in an non-optimal nash-equilibrium.  A number of insurtech’s such as Lemonade have recently attempted to evolve the business models to remove mis-trust, however much of the same issues remain unresolved. 


2. Secondly, despite the emergence of ***DeFi*** we are yet to see a proportional uptake of insurance solutions.  As a rough comparison, the largest ***DeFi*** protocol **Curve** currently has ***~$21bn*** in TVL compared to the largest insurance protocol **Nexus Mutual** which has ***~$540 million*** locked up.



# Idea 
Decentralization of the insurance model and providing parametric products (that purely relies on real-time and accurate data to trigger instant claims when certain conditions are met) removes these incentive issues.  Ergo’s oracle pool technology provides an excellent framework to begin designing and building out parametric insurance use-cases. 

Our team is interested in exploring a number of these use-cases which can support the growth and development of the Ergo ecosystem. To begin with, we will focus on smart-contract insurance and leverage learnings from existing projects on other chains. In the future, our goal is to build out insurance products which further support the growth and security of the Ergo ecosystem. One of these ideas relates to providing cover for graphics cards. Users could enter into a smart contract which tracks and monitors the performance of the graphics cards. Any damages and impacts on the customers ability to mine rewards and secure the network could trigger an automatic payout.
