# EUTXO Understanding

EUXTO stands for Extended Unspent Transaction Output. Similar to how Bitcoin and other UXTO blockchains, you can picture Ergo blockchain as a dataset of boxes.

In EUTXO, transactions consist of one/many unspent boxes as inputs and one/many unspent boxes as outputs. This means once the transaction is complete, the input unspent boxes are not considered spent and can no longer be used in other transactions as inputs. The transaction must also have output the same amount of input value(tokens/assets).
