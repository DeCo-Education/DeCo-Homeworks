# Addresses Understanding

The only information I found about addresses were in https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/wallet/address/. Addresses correspond to specific scripts and are used to protect a box. Ergo Addresses use Base58-encoding which provide some advantages to others. The following are some advantages that I understood:

    1) Prefixed - each address has a prefix that determined which network/address type if belonds too. This helps preventing mainnet token to testnet.
    2) Base58 avoid similar-looking characters and is friendly to double-clicking and line-breaking in emails.
